# How to test

You can use the runSuite file to test. 
Call the program by passing the name of the stem file (which contains all the names of the test files you write) as the first argument, then passing the name of the program you want to test (i.e. main-map) as the second argument.
If testing fails (i.e. expected output is different from actual results), then both results will be shown.
